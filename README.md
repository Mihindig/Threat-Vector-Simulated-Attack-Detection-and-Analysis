* Professional Reporting: Produced professional, structured cybersecurity reports emphasizing correlation, timelines, and insights.

# Tools Used

* Windows 10 VM: Target environment for attack simulation.

* Kali Linux VM: Attack platform utilizing penetration testing tools.

* Metasploit Framework: Conducted penetration testing and exploited identified vulnerabilities.

* Sysmon: Configured for comprehensive system event monitoring on Windows.

* Splunk: Used for log collection, analysis, alerting, and correlation of security events.

# Project Workflow

1. Environment Setup

 * Configured Windows 10 and Kali Linux VMs.

 * Installed Sysmon on Windows with a detailed configuration to capture critical events (process creation, network connections, file modifications).

 * Integrated Sysmon with Splunk to ensure real-time log ingestion and visibility.


2. Attack Simulation

 * Performed multiple attack scenarios using Metasploit, including privilege escalation and credential dumping.

 * Maintained a controlled simulation, ensuring each attack vector was clearly understood and analyzed.


3. Monitoring and Detection

 * Configured Splunk to ingest and parse Sysmon logs for detailed analysis.

 * Set up custom alerts in Splunk to detect:

 * Unusual process creations.

 * Unauthorized access attempts.

 * Network connections to suspicious IPs.

 * Developed correlation searches to validate attacks by linking multiple data points (process, network, file activities).


4. Assumption and Correlation Process

 * Based on initial findings, assumptions were made regarding attack paths and methods.

 * Correlated diverse event types in Splunk to verify these assumptions, including:
 
 * Process Relationships: Tracing parent-child process relationships to detect malicious chains.

 * Network Indicators: Analyzing unusual outbound connections post-exploitation.

 * Privilege Escalation: Identifying privilege escalation attempts by analyzing token usage and process ownership changes.

 * Used these correlations to establish a clear timeline of attack progression and validate findings.


5. Documentation of Findings

 * Recorded each stage of the attack with detailed observations.

 * Highlighted key IOCs and evidential artifacts, such as suspicious hashes, registry modifications, or unique process patterns.

 * Documented how correlation strengthened the accuracy of attack assumptions.

 * Provided visual representations (where applicable) such as Splunk dashboard snapshots or Sysmon log excerpts.

# Results & Insights

* Detection Success: Successfully detected and documented key attack stages through Sysmon and Splunk.

* Identified Gaps: Discovered security gaps, particularly in privilege escalation detection.

# Conclusion

This project provided critical hands-on experience in simulating, detecting, and analyzing cybersecurity attacks. The integration of Sysmon with Splunk proved invaluable for monitoring and responding to threats. The documentation process, particularly correlation validation, emphasized the importance of detailed analysis and structured reporting. This project not only strengthened technical capabilities but also highlighted the value of a methodical and professional approach to cybersecurity investigations.

# Initial Attack Detection

![1](https://github.com/Mihindig/Threat-Vector/blob/main/1.png)

* Initial detection of suspicious executable (.exe) in the Downloads folder. The medium integrity level suggests it wasnâ€™t executed with elevated privileges, but the location and naming convention align with common attacker tactics to disguise payloads.

# Threat Validation via VirusTotal

![kali linux IP validation](https://github.com/Mihindig/Threat-Vector/blob/main/kali%20linux%20IP%20validation.png)

* Validated the Kali Linux attacker's IP address using VirusTotal, confirming it as a private and non-malicious address. This step ensured that the simulated attack remained within the controlled environment and did not trigger external threat indicators

![malicious payload detection](https://github.com/Mihindig/Threat-Vector/blob/main/malicious%20payload%20detection.png)

![payload](https://github.com/Mihindig/Threat-Vector/blob/main/payload.png)

* The generated .exe payload was analyzed through VirusTotal, where it was flagged by 59 out of 73 security vendors with a 100% severity rating, confirming its classification as a Windows.Trojan.Metasploit. This validated the payloadâ€™s malicious nature and reinforced the effectiveness of detection mechanisms.

# Post-Exploitation Remediation and Cleanup

![network isolation](https://github.com/Mihindig/Threat-Vector/blob/main/network%20isolation.png)

* Isolated the compromised Windows machine by configuring it to a host-only adapter, ensuring it was disconnected from external networks to prevent any outbound communication or data exfiltration.

![empty recycle](https://github.com/Mihindig/Threat-Vector/blob/main/empty%20recycle.png)

* Manually terminated the malicious .exe process and ensured thorough removal by deleting it from the Downloads folder and permanently clearing it from the Recycle Bin, ensuring no residual presence.

# Proactive Defense

![firewall](https://github.com/Mihindig/Threat-Vector/blob/main/firewall%20rule.png)

* Configured a Windows Firewall outbound rule to block TCP traffic on port 4444, which was previously used for the Command and Control (C2) connection. This ensures any future unauthorized attempts to establish similar connections are effectively blocked.

#  System Security Re-Enablement

![windows defender](https://github.com/Mihindig/Threat-Vector/blob/main/defender.png)

![quick scan](https://github.com/Mihindig/Threat-Vector/blob/main/quick%20scan.png)

![startup](https://github.com/Mihindig/Threat-Vector/blob/main/empty%20startup.png)

* Checked critical registry run keys and the Startup folder for any signs of persistence mechanisms. No unauthorized entries were detected, confirming successful malware removal.

# Network Verification

![findstr](https://github.com/Mihindig/Threat-Vector/blob/main/findstr.png)

* Verified network status by executing netstat -ano | findstr 4444, confirming that the malicious listener process on port 4444 was successfully terminated and no longer active.
